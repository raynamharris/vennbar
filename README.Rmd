[Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) are a type of figure that I see a lot in the literature. While Venn diagrams are a great way to _conceptualize_ the goal of looking for shared or unique transcriptional responses to experimental manipulations, I don't think they are the best way to _vizualize empirical data_. 

I searched for “Venn” in Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham’s [R for
Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book and in Claus Wilke’s
[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)
book, for guidance alternatives to the Venn diagram. Neither book
discusses Venn diagrams, but they both provide valuable insight into
creating bar plots. Interestingly, the R for Data Science book does use
Venn diagrams to illustrate the differences between `inner_join` and
`full_join`, so that provides some evidence that Venn diagrams are
useful for conceptualizing ideas about data.)

The [UpSet plot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720993/)
has gained some popularity since 2016. I’ve made a handful of UpSet
plots with [`upsetR`](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR). While it is
possible to modify the aesthetics of an UpSet plot, it is very
challenging to manipulate the size, shape, colors, and font to the
degree that is needed to combine many plots into one multi-panel figure
for a manuscript.

In this repository, I turn 12 Venn diagrams from published research articles to four bar plots made with `tidyverse` and `cowplot`. I think these bar plots can be made more simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and reproducibility than a Venn diagram. 

Let me know what you think!

So, that's my comparison of four Venn diagrams and four possible bar plot alternatives. What do you think? Do you see the advantages? What other alternatives do you suggest? Comments welcome!
